Getting the Source
------------------
Embedded C Client library source is available at github repository - https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-embeddedc.git

Get the source from github repository: `git clone https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-embeddedc.git`

We shoud now have a directory `iot-embeddedc`, which is our `IOT_EMBDC_HOME`.

Installing the Dependencies and Building the Library
----------------------------------------------------
1. Set the environment variable IOT_EMBDC_HOME: `export IOT_EMBDC_HOME=$HOME/iot-embeddedc/`
2. Change to $IOT_EMBDC_HOME path and run the script - `cd $IOT_EMBDC_HOME ; ./setup.sh`

The `setsup.sh` script installs listed dependencies under Dependencies Section and it copies the dependencies into the lib directory after making necessary changes.

3. Create directory `build` within $IOT_EMBDC_HOME Path: `mkdir $IOT_EMBDC_HOME/build`
4. Change to `$IOT_EMBDC_HOME/build` directory to build the library: `cd $IOT_EMBDC_HOME/build`
5. Install `CMake` Utility if it's not already installed referring to the link - https://cmake.org/
6. Run `CMake` to collect all required build details and to create Makefile: `cmake ..`
7. Run make to build the library, samples and tests: `make`

Embedded C Client Library - Devices
===================================

The `iotfclient` is client for the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform service can be connected either as `device client` or `gateway client`. At the time of initialization, we need to specify the client type - `device client` or `gateway client`. We can use `device client` to connect to the Watson IoT platform, publish events and subscribe to commands.

Initialize
----------

There are 2 ways to initialize the `iotfclient` as Device Client.

### Passing as parameters

The function `initialize` takes the following details to connect as device to the IBM Watson IoT Platform service:

-   client - Pointer to the *iotfclient*
-   org - Your organization ID
-   type - The type of your device
-   id - The ID of your device
-   authmethod - Method of authentication (the only value currently supported is “token”)
-   authtoken - API key token (required if auth-method is “token”)
-   serverCertPath= custom server certificate path if there is one otherwise leave blank
-   useClientCertificates= 1 to use client certificates and 0 for not to use client certificates
-   rootCACertPath= CA Certificate(s) path if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
-   clientCertPath= Client Certificate Path if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
-   clientKeyPath= Client Private Key Path if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
-   clientType = 0 for device client
``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "deviceclient.h"
   ....
   ....

   iotfclient client;

   if(!useCerts)
	rc = initialize(&client,orgId,"internetofthings.ibmcloud.com",devType,            
	                devId,"token",devToken,NULL,useCerts,NULL,NULL,NULL,0);
   else
	rc = initialize(&client,orgId,"internetofthings.ibmcloud.com",devType,
			devId,"token",devToken,NULL,useCerts,rootCACertPath,clientCertPath,clientKeyPath,0);
   ....
```

### Using a configuration file

The function `initialize_configfile` takes pointer to `iotfclient`, the configuration file path and 0 for `clientType` as parameters:

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "deviceclient.h"
   ....
   ....
   char* configFilePath="./device.cfg";
   iotfclient client;

   rc = initialize_configfile(&client, configFilePath,0);
   free(configFilePath);

   ....
```

The configuration file must be in the below given format:

``` {.sourceCode .}
org=$orgId
domain=$domainName
type=$myDeviceType
id=$myDeviceId
auth-method=token
auth-token=$token
serverCertPath=$customServerCertificatePath
useClientCertificates=0 or 1
rootCACertPath=$rootCACertPath if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
clientCertPath=$clientCertPath if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
clientKeyPath=$clientKeyPath if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
```

##### Return codes

Following are the return codes in the `initialize` function:

* CONFIG_FILE_ERROR   -3
* MISSING_INPUT_PARAM   -4


Connect
-------

After initializing the `iotfclient`, we can connect to the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform by calling the `connectiotf` function

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "deviceclient.h"
   ....
   ....
   char* configFilePath="./device.cfg";
   iotfclient client;

   rc = initialize_configfile(&client, configFilePath,0);
   free(configFilePath);

   if(rc != SUCCESS){
       printf("initialize failed and returned rc = %d.\n Quitting..", rc);
       return 0;
   }

   rc = connectiotf(&client);

   if(rc != SUCCESS){
       printf("Connection failed and returned rc = %d.\n Quitting..", rc);
       return 0;
   }
   ....
```

##### Return Codes

The IoTF `connectiotf` function return codes are as shown below:

* MQTTCLIENT_SUCCESS   0
* MQTTCLIENT_FAILURE   -1
* MQTTCLIENT_DISCONNECTED   -3
* MQTTCLIENT_MAX_MESSAGES_INFLIGHT   -4
* MQTTCLIENT_BAD_UTF8_STRING   -5
* MQTTCLIENT_BAD_QOS   -9
* MQTTCLIENT_NOT_AUTHORIZED   5

Handling commands
-----------------

When the device client connects in registered mode, to process specific commands, we need to subscribe to commands by calling the function `subscribeCommands` and then register a command callback function by calling the function `setCommandHandler`. 

The commands are returned as:
-   commandName - name of the command invoked
-   format - e.g json, xml
-   payload

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "deviceclient.h"
....
....

void myCallback (char* commandName, char* format, void* payload)
{
	printf("------------------------------------\n" );
	printf("The command received :: %s\n", commandName);
	printf("format : %s\n", format);
	printf("Payload is : %s\n", (char *)payload);

	printf("------------------------------------\n" );
}
 ...
 ...
 char* configFilePath="./device.cfg";
 iotfclient client;
 ....

 rc = connectiotf(&client);

 if(rc != SUCCESS){
    printf("Connection failed and returned rc = %d.\n Quitting..", rc);
    return 0;
 }
 subscribeCommands(&client);
 setCommandHandler(&client, myCallback);
 yield(&client,1000);
 ....

```

**Note** : `yield` function must be called periodically to receive commands.

Publishing events
------------------

Events can be published by using the function `publishEvent`. The parameters to the function are:

-   eventType - Type of event to be published e.g status, gps
-   eventFormat - Format of the event e.g json
-   data - Payload of the event
-   QoS - qos for the publish event. Supported values : QOS0, QOS1, QOS2

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "deviceclient.h"
 ....
 rc = connectiotf (&client);
 char *payload = {\"d\" : {\"temp\" : 34 }};

 rc= publishEvent("status","json", "{\"d\" : {\"temp\" : 34 }}", QOS0);
 ....
```

Disconnect Client
------------------

Disconnects the client, releases the connections and frees the memory.

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "deviceclient.h"
 ....
 rc = connectiotf (org, type, id , authmethod, authtoken);
 char *payload = {\"d\" : {\"temp\" : 34 }};

 rc= publishEvent("status","json", payload , QOS0);
 ...
 rc = disconnect(&client);
 ....
```


Embedded C Client Library - Gateways
=====================================

The `iotfclient` also be used as the gateway client for the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform. We can use gateway client to connect to the Watson IoT platform, publish gateway events, publish device events on behalf of the devices, subscribe to both gateway and device commands.

Initialize
----------

There are 2 ways to initialize the `iotfclient` as Gateway Client.

### Passing as parameters

The function `initialize` takes the following details to connect as gateway client to the IBM Watson IoT Platform service:

-   client - Pointer to the *iotfclient*
-   org - Your organization ID
-   type - The type of your gateway
-   id - The ID of your gateway
-   authmethod - Method of authentication (the only value currently
    supported is “token”)
-   authtoken - Gateway authentication token (required if auth-method is “token”)
-   serverCertPath= custom server certificate path if there is one otherwise leave blank
-   useClientCertificates= 1 to use client certificates and 0 for not to use client certificates
-   rootCACertPath= CA Certificate(s) path if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
-   clientCertPath= Client Certificate Path if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
-   clientKeyPath= Client Private Key Path if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
-   clientType = 1 for gateway client

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "gatewayclient.h"
   ....
   ....

   iotfclient client;

   if(!useCerts)
	rc = initialize(&client,orgId,"internetofthings.ibmcloud.com",devType,            
	                devId,"token",devToken,NULL,useCerts,NULL,NULL,NULL,1);
   else
	rc = initialize(&client,orgId,"internetofthings.ibmcloud.com",devType,
			devId,"token",devToken,NULL,useCerts,rootCACertPath,clientCertPath,clientKeyPath,1);
```

### Using a configuration file

The function `initialize_configfile` takes pointer to `iotfclient`, the configuration file path and 1 for `clientType` as parameters.

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "gatewayclient.h"
   ....
   ....
   char* configFilePath = "./gateway.cfg;
   iotfclient client;

   rc = initialize_configfile(&client, configFilePath,1);

   ....
```

The configuration file must be in the below given format:

``` {.sourceCode .}
org=$orgId
domain=$domainName
type=$myGatewayType
id=$myGatewayId
auth-method=token
auth-token=$token
serverCertPath=$customServerCertificatePath
useClientCertificates=0 or 1
rootCACertPath=$rootCACertPath if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
clientCertPath=$clientCertPath if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
clientKeyPath=$clientKeyPath if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
```

##### Return codes

Following are the return codes in the `initialize` and `initialize_configfile` function for gateway client:

* CONFIG_FILE_ERROR   -3
* MISSING_INPUT_PARAM   -4
* QUICKSTART_NOT_SUPPORTED  -5


Connect
-------

After initializing the `gatewayclient`, we can connect to IBM Watson IoT Platform by calling the `connectiotf` function:

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "gatewayclient.h"
  ....
  ....
  char* configFilePath="gateway.cfg";
  iotfclient client;

  .....

  rc = initialize_configfile(&client, configFilePath,1);

  if(rc != SUCCESS){
    printf("initialize failed and returned rc = %d.\n Quitting..", rc);
    return 0;
  }

  rc = connectiotf(&client);

  if(rc != SUCCESS){
    printf("Connection failed and returned rc = %d.\n Quitting..", rc);
    return 0;
  }
   ....
```

##### Return Codes

The IoTF `connectiotf` function return codes:

* MQTTCLIENT_SUCCESS   0
* MQTTCLIENT_FAILURE   -1
* MQTTCLIENT_DISCONNECTED   -3
* MQTTCLIENT_MAX_MESSAGES_INFLIGHT   -4
* MQTTCLIENT_BAD_UTF8_STRING   -5
* MQTTCLIENT_BAD_QOS   -9
* MQTTCLIENT_NOT_AUTHORIZED   5

Handling commands
-----------------

When the gateway client connects, it does not automatically subscribe to commands for the gateway and devices. We need to subscribe ourselves using the functions -  `subscribeToDeviceCommands` and `subscribeToGatewayCommands`.
For subscribing for device commands we need to use `subscribeToDeviceCommands`. We need to provide the deviceType , deivceId, commandName, the commandFormat and QOS as parameters.

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "gatewayclient.h"
  ....
  ....
  char* configFilePath="./gateway.cfg";
  iotfclient client;

  .....

  rc = initialize_configfile(&client, configFilePath,1);

  if(rc != SUCCESS){
    printf("initialize failed and returned rc = %d.\n Quitting..", rc);
    return 0;
  }

  rc = connectiotf(&client);

  if(rc != SUCCESS){
    printf("Connection failed and returned rc = %d.\n Quitting..", rc);
    return 0;
  }
   ....
  // providing "+" will subscribe to all the command of all formats.
  subscribeToDeviceCommands(&client, "elevator", "elevator-1", "+", "+", 0);
  ....
```

##### Process Commands

To process specific commands we need to register a command callback function by calling the function
`setGatewayCommandHandler`. The commands are returned in the below format:

-   type - Type of the Gateway/Device
-   id - ID of the Gateway/Device
-   commandName - name of the command invoked
-   format - e.g json, xml
-   payload
-   payloadlen - Length of the payload

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "gatewayclient.h"
......

//Command Handler
void myCallback (char* type, char* id, char* commandName, char *format, void* payload, size_t payloadlen)
{
	printf("------------------------------------\n" );
	printf("Type is : %s\n", type);
	printf("Id is : %s\n", id);
	printf("The command received :: %s\n", commandName);
	printf("format : %s\n", format);
	printf("Payload is : %.*s\n", (int)payloadlen, (char *)payload);
	printf("------------------------------------\n" );
}
  ....
  ....
  char* configFilePath="./gateway.cfg";
  iotfclient client;

  .....

  rc = initialize_configfile(&client, configFilePath,1);

  if(rc != SUCCESS){
    printf("initialize failed and returned rc = %d.\n Quitting..", rc);
    return 0;
  }

  rc = connectiotf(&client);

  if(rc != SUCCESS){
    printf("Connection failed and returned rc = %d.\n Quitting..", rc);
    return 0;
  }
   ....
  // providing "+" will subscribe to all the command of all formats.
  subscribeToDeviceCommands(&client, "elevator", "elevator-1", "+", "+", 0);

  //Registering the function "myCallback" as the command handler.
  setGatewayCommandHandler(&client, myCallback);

  //Yield for receiving commands.
  yield(&client, 1000);

  ....

```

**Note** : `yield` function must be called periodically to receive commands.

Publishing events
------------------
A gateway can publish events from itself and on behalf of any device connected via the gateway. Events can be published by using the functions `publishGatewayEvents` and `publishDeviceEvents` with the below parameters:

-   eventType - Type of event to be published e.g status, gps
-   eventFormat - Format of the event e.g json
-   data - Payload of the event
-   QoS - qos for the publish event. Supported values : QOS0, QOS1, QOS2

##### Publish Gateway Events

``` {.sourceCode .c}
.....
    //publishing gateway events
    rc= publishGatewayEvent(&client, "elevatorDevices","elevatorGateway", "{\"d\" : {\"temp\" : 34 }}", QOS0);

 ....
```

##### Publish Device Events on behalf of a device

``` {.sourceCode .c}
   //publishing device events on behalf of a device
   rc= publishDeviceEvent(&client, "elevator","elevator-1","status","json", "{\"d\" : {\"temp\" : 34 }}", QOS0);
 ....
```

Disconnect Client
------------------

Disconnects the client, releases the connections and frees the memory

``` {.sourceCode .c}
    //Be sure to disconnect the gateway at exit
    disconnectGateway(&client);
```

Running the Device and Gateway Samples
--------------------------------------
There are couple of sample programs available in the samples directory under `$IOT_EMBDC_HOME` directory. Before running them, 
- Update the configuration files as described in the above sections.
- To enable logging, set the envrionment variable IOT_EMBDC_LOGGING - `export IOT_EMBDC_LOGGING=ON`
- If `IOT_EMBDC_HOME` is set, then `$IOT_EMBDC_HOME/iotclient.log` is used for logging otherwise `./iotclient.log` is used.

Run helloWorld sample being in the path `$IOT_EMBDC_HOME/build`:

       ./samples/helloWorld orgID deviceType deviceId token useCerts caCertsPath clientCertPath clientKeyPath

Run Device Sample being in the path `$IOT_EMBDC_HOME/build`:

	./samples/sampleDevice
	
Run Gateway Sample being in the path `$IOT_EMBDC_HOME/build`:

	./samples/sampleGateway


Embedded C Library - Managed Device
-----------------------------------

Introduction
-------------

This Embedded C Library describes how to use devices and gateways with the Embedded C WIoTP client library.

This section contains information on how devices can connect to the Internet of Things Platform Device Management service using c and perform device management operations like  location update, add logs and diagnostics update.



Device Management
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The <a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/devices/device_mgmt/index.html">device management</a> feature enhances the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform service with new capabilities for managing devices. Device management makes a distinction between managed and unmanaged devices:

* **Managed Devices** are defined as devices which have a management agent installed. The management agent sends and receives device metadata and responds to device management commands from the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform.
* **Unmanaged Devices** are any devices which do not have a device management agent. All devices begin their lifecycle as unmanaged devices, and can transition to managed devices by sending a message from a device management agent to the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Connecting to the Internet of Things Platform Device Management Service
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initialize
----------

There are 2 ways to initialize the `iotfclient`.

### Passing as parameters

The function `initialize` takes the following details as parameters:

-   client - Pointer to the *iotfclient*
-   org - Your organization ID
-   type - The type of your device
-   id - The ID of your device
-   authmethod - Method of authentication (the only value currently
    supported is “token”)
-   authtoken - API key token (required if auth-method is “token”)
-   serverCertPath= custom server certificate path if there is one otherwise leave blank
-   useClientCertificates= 1 to use client certificates and 0 for not to use client certificates
-   rootCACertPath= CA Certificate(s) path if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
-   clientCertPath= Client Certificate Path if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
-   clientKeyPath= Client Private Key Path if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "devicemanagementclient.h"
   ....
   ....
   //quickstart
   rc = initialize_dm("quickstart",NULL,"iotsample","001122334455",NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);
   //registered
   rc = initialize_dm("orgid","domain","type","id","token","authtoken",NULL,1,"rootCACertPath",
                      "ClientSertPath","ClientKeyPath");
   ....
```

### Using a configuration file

The function `initialize_configfile_dm` takes the configuration file path as a parameter.

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "devicemanagementclient.h"
   ....
   ....
   char *filePath = "./device.cfg";
   rc = initialize_configfile_dm(filePath);
   ....
```

The configuration file must be in the below given format:

``` {.sourceCode .}
org=$orgId
domain=$domainName
type=$myDeviceType
id=$myDeviceId
auth-method=token
auth-token=$token
serverCertPath=$customServerCertificatePath
useClientCertificates=0 or 1
rootCACertPath=$rootCACertPath if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
clientCertPath=$clientCertPath if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
clientKeyPath=$clientKeyPath if useClientCertificates=1 otherwise leave blank
```

##### Return codes

Following are the return codes in the `initialize` function

* CONFIG_FILE_ERROR   -3
* MISSING_INPUT_PARAM   -4


Connect
-------

After initializing the `iotfclient`, you can connect to the IBM Watson Internet of Things
Platform by calling the `connectiotf_dm` function

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "devicemanagementclient.h"
   ....
   ....
   char *configFilePath = "./device.cfg";

   rc = initialize_configfile_dm(configFilePath);

   if(rc != SUCCESS){
       printf("initialize failed and returned rc = %d.\n Quitting..", rc);
       return 0;
   }

   rc = connectiotf_dm();

   if(rc != SUCCESS){
       printf("Connection failed and returned rc = %d.\n Quitting..", rc);
       return 0;
   }
   ....
```

##### Return Codes

The IoTF `connectiotf_dm` function return codes

* MQTTCLIENT_SUCCESS   0
* MQTTCLIENT_FAILURE   -1
* MQTTCLIENT_DISCONNECTED   -3
* MQTTCLIENT_MAX_MESSAGES_INFLIGHT   -4
* MQTTCLIENT_BAD_UTF8_STRING   -5
* MQTTCLIENT_BAD_QOS   -9
* MQTTCLIENT_NOT_AUTHORIZED   5

Create DeviceData
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The  <a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/reference/device_model.html">device model </a> describes the metadata and management characteristics of a device. The device database in the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform is the master source of device information. Applications and managed devices are able to send updates to the database such as a location or the progress of a firmware update. Once these updates are received by the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform, the device database is updated, making the information available to applications.

The device model in the WIoTP client library is represented as DeviceData and to create a DeviceData one needs to create the following objects,

* DeviceInfo (Optional)
* DeviceLocation (Optional, required only if the device wants to be notified about the location set by the application through Watson IoT Platform API)
* DeviceFirmware (Optional)
* DeviceMetadata (optional)

The following code snippet shows how to create the object ManagedDevice along with DeviceMetadata with sample data:

``` {.sourceCode .c}
strcpy(client.DeviceData.deviceInfo.serialNumber, "10087" );
strcpy(client.DeviceData.deviceInfo.manufacturer , "IBM");
strcpy(client.DeviceData.deviceInfo.model , "7865");
strcpy(client.DeviceData.deviceInfo.deviceClass , "A");
strcpy(client.DeviceData.deviceInfo.description , "My Ras");
strcpy(client.DeviceData.deviceInfo.fwVersion , "1.0.0");
strcpy(client.DeviceData.deviceInfo.hwVersion , "1.0");
strcpy(client.DeviceData.deviceInfo.descriptiveLocation , "EGL C");
strcpy(client.DeviceData.metadata.metadata ,"{}");    
```
Note : meta data value must be a json string, for example :"{\"key\":\"string value \"}"

Register Callback function
------------------------------------------------------------------
 To process the response of device management request we need to register a  callback function by calling the function
`setManagedHandler_dm`. The commands are returned as

-   Status - status of response
-   requestId -  ID of the request to which the response is.
-   payload

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "devicemanagementclient.h"

void managedCallBack (char* Status, char* requestId, void* payload)
{
	printf("\n------------------------------------\n" );
	printf("Status :: %s\n", Status);
	printf("requestId : %s\n", requestId);
	printf("Payload is : %s\n", (char *)payload);
	printf("------------------------------------\n" );
}
 ...
 ...
 char *filePath = "./device.cfg";
 rc = connectiotfConfig_dm(filePath);
 setCommandHandler_dm(myCallback);
 setManagedHandler_dm(managedCallBack );

 ....
```
Following are the status code for the device Management response,
<ul>
    <li>200: The operation was successful.</li>
    <li>400: The input message does not match the expected format, or one of the values is out of the valid range.</li>
    <li>404: The topic name is incorrect, or the device is not in the database.</li>
    <li>409: A conflict occurred during the device database update. To resolve this, simplify the operation is necessary.</li>
</ul>



Subscribe
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In order to get the response for the each manage device request we need to make an subscription to all the commands by calling
`subscribeCommands_dm` function
``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "devicemanagementclient.h"
 ...
 ...
 char *filePath = "./device.cfg";
 rc = connectiotfConfig_dm(filePath);
 setCommandHandler_dm(myCallback);
 setManagedHandler_dm(managedCallBack );
 subscribeCommands_dm();
 ....
```



Manage
------------------------------------------------------------------
The device can invoke publishManageEvent() function to participate in device management activities of the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform

``` {.sourceCode .c}
	publishManageEvent(4000,1,1, reqId);
```
As shown, this function accepts following 4 parameters,
* *lifetime* The length of time in seconds within which the device must send another **Manage device** request in order to avoid being reverted to an unmanaged device and marked as dormant. If set to 0, the managed device will not become dormant. When set, the minimum supported setting is 3600 (1 hour).
* *supportFirmwareActions* Tells whether the device supports firmware actions or not. The device must add a firmware handler to handle the firmware requests.
* *supportDeviceActions* Tells whether the device supports Device actions or not. The device must add a Device action handler to handle the reboot and factory reset
 requests.
* *request ID* out value of Request Id for the current request.

Unmanage
-----------------------------------------------------

A device can invoke `sendUnmanageRequest()` function when it no longer needs to be managed. The IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform will no longer send new device management requests to this device and all device management requests from this device will be rejected other than a **Manage device** request.

``` {.sourceCode .c}
	publishUnManageEvent(reqId);
```
As shown, this function accepts following 1 parameter,
* *request ID* out value of Request Id for the current request.

Append/Clear Error Codes
-----------------------------------------------

Devices can choose to notify the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform about changes in their error status. The Device can invoke  `addErrorCode()` function to add the current error code to Watson IoT Platform.

``` {.sourceCode .c}
	addErrorCode(121 , reqId);
```
As shown, this function accepts following 3 parameters,
* *ErrorCode* error code to be added as integer.
* *request ID* out value of Request Id for the current request.
Also, the ErrorCodes can be cleared from IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform by calling the `clearErrorCodes()` function as follows:

``` {.sourceCode .c}
	clearErrorCodes(reqId);
```
As shown, this function accepts following 2 parameters,
* *request ID* out value of Request Id for the current request.

Append/Clear Log messages
-----------------------------
Devices can choose to notify the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform about changes by adding a new log entry. Log entry includes a log messages, its time stamp and severity, as well as an optional base64-encoded binary diagnostic data. The Devices can invoke `addLog()` function to send log messages,

``` {.sourceCode .c}
addLog("test","",1, reqId);
```
As shown, this function accepts following 2 parameters,
* *message* log information.
* *data* optional base64-encoded binary diagnostic data as string.
* *request ID* out value of Request Id for the current request.


Also, the log messages can be cleared from IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform by calling the `clearLogs()` function as follows:

``` {.sourceCode .c}
clearLogs(reqId);
```
As shown, this function accepts following 2 parameters,
* *request ID* out value of Request Id for the current request.

The device diagnostics operations are intended to provide information on device errors, and does not provide diagnostic information relating to the devices connection to the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform.

Refer to the documentation <a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/devices/device_mgmt/index.html#/update-location#update-location">documentation</a> for more information about the Diagnostics operation.


Firmware Actions
--------------------

The firmware update process is separated into two distinct actions:

    Downloading Firmware
    Updating Firmware.

The device needs to do the following activities to support Firmware Actions:

1. Construct DeviceFirmware details (Optional)

In order to perform Firmware actions the device can optionally populate the DeviceFirmware details in the DeviceData as follows:


strcpy(dmClient.DeviceData.mgmt.firmware.version,"FirmwareVersion");
strcpy(dmClient.DeviceData.mgmt.firmware.name,"FirmwareName");
strcpy( dmClient.DeviceData.mgmt.firmware.url,"FirmwareUrl");
strcpy(dmClient.DeviceData.mgmt.firmware.verifier,"FirmwareVerifier");
dmClient.DeviceData.mgmt.firmware.state=FIRMWARESTATE_IDLE;

rc = initialize_configfile_dm(configFilePath);
rc = connectiotf_dm();

The DeviceFirmware details represents the current firmware of the device and will be used to report the status of the Firmware Download and Firmware Update actions to IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform. In case this DeviceFirmware details is not constructed by the device, then the library creates an empty object and reports the status to Watson IoT Platform.

2. Inform the server about the Firmware action support

The device needs to set the firmware action flag to true in order for the server to initiate the firmware request. This can be achieved by invoking the publishManageEvent() method with a true value for supportFirmwareActions parameter,

publishManageEvent(3600, true, false,reqId);

Once the support is informed to the DM server, the server then forwards the firmware actions to the device.

3. Create the Firmware Action Handler

In order to support the Firmware action, the device needs to create a handler and set the callback to the Client library by using the following methods:

void setFirmwareDownloadHandler(actionCallback downloadHandler);
void setFirmwareUpdateHandler(actionCallback updateHandler);

3.1 Sample implementation of downloadFirmware

The implementation must add a logic to download the firmware and report the status of the download via changeFirmwareState(state) method. If the Firmware Download operation is successful, then the state of the firmware to be set to DOWNLOADED and UpdateStatus should be set to SUCCESS.

If an error occurs during Firmware Download the state should be set to IDLE and updateStatus should be set to one of the error status values:

    OUT_OF_MEMORY
    CONNECTION_LOST
    INVALID_URI

Device can check the integrity of the downloaded firmware image using the verifier and report the status back to IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform. The verifier can be set by the device during the startup or as part of the Download Firmware request by the application.

3.2 Sample implementation of updateFirmware

The implementation must add a logic to install the downloaded firmware and report the status of the update. If the Firmware Update operation is successful, then the state of the firmware should to be set to IDLE and UpdateStatus should be set to SUCCESS.

If an error occurs during Firmware Update, updateStatus should be set to one of the error status values:

    OUT_OF_MEMORY
    UNSUPPORTED_IMAGE

Refer to this page for more information about the Firmware action.
Device Actions

The IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform supports the following device actions:

    Reboot
    Factory Reset

The device needs to do the following activities to support Device Actions:

1. Inform server about the Device Actions support

In order to perform Reboot and Factory Reset, the device needs to inform the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform about its support first. This can be achieved by invoking the publishManageEvent() method with a true value for supportDeviceActions parameter,

Once the support is informed to the DM server, the server then forwards the device action requests to the device.

2. Create the Device Action Handler

In order to support the device action, the device needs to create a handler and set the callback to the Client library by using the following methods:

void setRebootHandler(commandCallback rebootHandler);
void setFactoryResetHandler(commandCallback resetHandler);

2.1 Sample implementation of handleReboot

The implementation must add a logic to reboot the device and report the status of the reboot. Upon receiving the request, the device first needs to inform the server about the support(or failure) before proceeding with the actual reboot. And if the device can not reboot the device or any other error during the reboot, the device can update the status along with an optional message.

2.2 Sample implementation of handleFactoryReset

The implementation must add a logic to reset the device to factory settings and report the status of the factory reset. Upon receiving the request, the device first needs to inform the server about the support(or failure) before proceeding with the actual reset. And if the sample can not reset the device or any other error during the reset, the device can update the status along with an optional message.

Refer to <a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/devices/device_mgmt/requests.html#/firmware-actions#firmware-actions" >this page</a> for more information about the Device Action.

Handling commands
-----------------

When the device client connects, it automatically subscribes to any
command for this device. To process specific commands you need to
register a command callback function by calling the function
`setCommandHandler`. The commands are returned as

-   commandName - name of the command invoked
-   format - e.g json, xml
-   payload

``` {.sourceCode .c}
#include "devicemanagementclient.h"

void myCallback (char* commandName, char* format, void* payload)
{
   printf("The command received :: %s\n", commandName);
   printf("format : %s\n", format);
   printf("Payload is : %s\n", (char *)payload);
}
 ...
 ...
 char *filePath = "./device.cfg";
 rc = connectiotfConfig_dm(filePath);
 setCommandHandler_dm(myCallback);

 yield_dm(100);
 ....
```

**Note** : `yield_dm` function must be called periodically to receive commands.



Disconnect Client
------------------

Disconnects the client and releases the connections

``` {.sourceCode .c}
  disconnect_dm();
```
As shown, this function accepts following parameter,
* *ManagedDevice struct Instance* which has all the device info filled
