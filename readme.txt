The FP-NET-BLESTAR1 is a function package for STM32Cube.
The software runs on the STM32 and includes drivers for ST’s
BlueNRG Bluetooth Low Energy and WiFi expansion boards.
This package is built on STM32Cube software technology to ease
portability across different STM32 microcontrollers.
The software comes with an example of implementation of the drivers running
on the X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1 and X-NUCLEO-IDW01M1, when both connected
to an STM32 NUCLEO. Alternatively, the B-L475E-IOT01A Discovery kit for IoT 
node, equipped with the BLE SPBTLE-RF module and the WiFi ISM43362-M3G-L44 
(from Inventek Systems), can be used.

For the content of this package, the development toolchains and compilers
to use and the supported devices and evaluation boards, refer to the
Release Notes in the root directory of this package.

The simplest way to start using this expansion software is to run the
sample applications in Projects folder.
The readme.txt included in the Applications folder provides the
description of all applications and the instructions on how to run them.
